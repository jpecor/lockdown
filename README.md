# lockdown

This is my first attempt at using Pandas, and I am attempting to apply it reading and tracking COVID-19 cases during the social distancing "lockdown".

Admittedly, "lockdown" isn't the most descriptive name for the program, but I honestly wanted to avoid naming the program after the virus.  I'm not too worried about the marketing angle for this small project.  

The program is fetching data from the Johns Hopkins data repository here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
